## Introduction

The **ECU-error-manager** app is designed to streamline the diagnostic process by eliminating the need for mechanics and service assistants to navigate through often unintuitive, vendor-specific applications. These traditional tools can slow down troubleshooting by forcing users to manually search for error codes.

With ECU-error-manager, users can quickly access detailed descriptions of errors generated by any vehicle's ECU. The app features multiple settings that allow flexible searches based on the code type provided by the display—ensuring compatibility with both older and newer vehicle models. This adaptability makes it a valuable tool for efficient diagnostics and faster repair workflows.

For this project, given the very small database (only 20 MB), it wasn’t strictly necessary to build a full-stack application with separate client, server, and database layers. In such cases, a pure React application would suffice to simplify data fetching. However, the full-stack architecture was intentionally implemented as both an exercise and a demonstration of modern web development practices.

The application is available in two versions.

## Version 1: Node, React & MongoDB

Built using Node, React, and MongoDB, this version features:
- **Client:** A React-based front-end that sends requests for error code descriptions.
- **Server:** A Node server that processes the client requests, queries the MongoDB database, and returns the results.
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas stores the comprehensive database of ECU error codes.

**Deployment:**  
- The client is deployed on **Netlify**.
- The server is deployed on **Render**.
- The MongoDB database is hosted on **MongoDB Atlas**.

_Note:_ The deployment keys must be loaded appropriately. For example, the Render key should be set in the Netlify environment variables, and the MongoDB key should be configured in the Render environment variables.

## Version 2: Flask & React

This version is built using Flask (Python) for the server-side and React for the client-side, with the following characteristics:
- **Integrated Database:** Instead of using an external database, the database is integrated within the server itself, which simplifies the architecture.
- **Client-Server Interaction:** The React front-end calls the Flask API endpoints in a similar fashion as Version 1, retrieving error code descriptions as needed.

**Deployment Reminder:**  
As with Version 1, ensure that all necessary access keys are loaded into the deployment environment. For instance, when using deployment frameworks:
- Configure the relevant keys (such as for Render or any other service) in the corresponding environment variables of the deployment platform.
